# Bistro Management

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

Bistro Management is software for restaurants to manage customer orders, assign orders to each of the chefs they have in the restaurant, manage the inventory of ingredients in the warehouses, and keep customers updated in real time with the status of your order and delivery time.
